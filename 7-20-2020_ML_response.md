Due to COVID 19 and the implemintation of safety guidlines, the informing and enforcement of these guidelines are needed to
protect the health of others. The problem is that some people will not follow these guidelines. To aid in enforcement and targeted
informing of certain groups, can a machine learning model be made that predicts the probability that a person will wear a mask
based upon their personal characteristics? The personal characteristics would include age, race, politicla party, gender, etc. and
whether or not a person would wear a mask would be determined by a connotative analysis from that person's social media post. 

Problems with the study would be first obtaining data that includes personal characteristics and posts of a large number of individuals.
This dataset may also oversample certain groups of people such as a younger age group. That is even if this identifying information
is available from social media outlets to be downloaded as a dataset. Another obstacle of the study is using a conotation of 
a tweet as explicet denial to wear a mask. A person may complain about wearing a mask and therefore have a negative conotation, but
will still wear a mask. A possible avenue around a lack of data is using data from numerous social media sites; however, I could
then be sampling the same person twice if they are on both platforms. 

Other important variables that I would like to include in the model is whether or not the person is a parent that is caring for children,
caring for their own parents, or have health problems.
