1) Traditional programming had the inputs of the data and rules which gave an answer. 
Machine learning takes the data and answers as an input and outputs the rules needed.

2) 4.039781 & 4.072095 
These answers are different because the algorithm answers in probabilities of the best answer.

3) The best deal is house 2 ($97,000 for 3 bedrooms) and the worst deal is house 5 ($250,000 for 2 bedrooms)
This is explained when comparing the prices offered to the prices predicted by the 1 layer 1 neuron nueral network that are posted below:
2 beds - 169.26517
3 beds - 234.5404
4 beds - 299.81564
5 beds - 365.09088

When subtracting the predicted cost from the posted cost, house 2 yields the largest negative value, meaning it is the largest difference between the estimated price
and what you would actually pay. This is the best deal because the buyinng offer is the lowest compared to the predicted price. On the contrary, house 5, 
when the predicted price is subtracted from the buying price, yields the largest positive value. This means the asking price is over the amount 
that is predicted based upon other offers and therefore is the worst deal.
