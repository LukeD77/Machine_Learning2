More images to come, and hopefully even a meme.

The inspiration behind these images are that I find trees to be beautiful already, but altering them in a unique way with different patterns to emphasize aspects of their shape allows for a greater appreciation.

The inspiration for this is that owls, specifically barn owls are my favorite animal. Sadly though they screech instead of hoot but you get what you get.
